# Motion-Sensor
**The IR Motion Sensor** detects movement by sensing changes in infrared radiation (heat) within its surroundings. It uses Passive Infrared (PIR) technology to identify motion from people, animals, or other heat-emitting objects. When a warm body enters its detection range, the sensor sends a signal that can be used to trigger devices such as alarms, lights, or automatic doors.

## This sensor is suitable for:
- Security and alarm systems
- Energy-saving automatic lighting
- Motion-activated devices in smart homes
